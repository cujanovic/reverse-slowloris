# reverse-slowloris

This is a take on the
[slowloris attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security))
except done in reverse. Anyone who connects to this server will be sent an
infinite slow stream of data until they terminate the connection.

This came up when I was looking through my nginx access logs and saw many
requests for endpoints in search of security holes, like `/phpmyadmin`,
`/.git/HEAD` and many others. I took a sample of the most common endpoints
requested and added a block like this to my nginx configuration

    location /wp-login.php {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
        proxy_buffering off;
    }
    location /mysql {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
        proxy_buffering off;
    }
    location /databases {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
        proxy_buffering off;
    }

# install

`
go mod init reverse-slowloris && go mod tidy && go build
`

# run

`reverse-slowloris payload.txt 8080`


I would then include this in any configurations in my nginx `conf.d` directory
for easy reuse. I also adjusted the base nginx conf to proxy into this server,
for some handling when no hostname is specified (connecting via IP address)

I don't know if this annoys the bots at all, but I have seen some stay connected
for over 14 hours.
